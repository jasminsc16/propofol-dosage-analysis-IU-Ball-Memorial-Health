# Project Background
IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital (BMH), a leading regional teaching hospital within the Indiana University Health system, serves as a major referral center for East Central Indiana. Collaborating with the Director of Pharmacy Services and the Critical Care Research Team, I conduct an analysis to evaluate sedation and pain management patterns in the ICU, specifically examining why propofol infusion rates at BMH are consistently higher than those observed across other IU Health hospitals. Using data extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) system, this project explores patient characteristics, co-administered sedatives, and propofol outcome measures to uncover patterns driving high-dose propofol use. The resulting insights will inform recommendations to align clinical practice with evidence-based guidelines and support safer, more consistent sedation strategies across the health system.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

•	**Propofol Outcome Measures:** An analysis of the duration and frequency of high dose propofol use (>50 mcg/kg/min), including total infusion hours/days on infusion.

•	**Patient Characteristics Analysis:** Evaluation of demographic factors: sex, age, height, and weight.

•	**Co-Administered Sedatives:** An assessment of pain management effectiveness (measured by RASS or CPOT) in conjunction with sedatives such as dexmedetomidine and fentanyl.

•	**IU Health Hospitals Comparisons:** An evaluation of propofol and co-administered sedatives across IU Health hospitals to identify system-wide variation.
