# Project Background
IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital (BMH), a leading regional teaching hospital within the Indiana University Health system, serves as a major referral center for East Central Indiana. Collaborating with the Director of Pharmacy Services and the Critical Care Research Team, I conduct an analysis to evaluate sedation and pain management patterns in the ICU, specifically examining why propofol infusion rates at BMH are consistently higher than those observed across other IU Health hospitals. Using data extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) system, this project explores patient characteristics, co-administered sedatives, and propofol outcome measures to uncover patterns driving high-dose propofol use. The resulting insights will inform recommendations to align clinical practice with evidence-based guidelines and support safer, more consistent sedation strategies across the health system.
